I am a second year master student in [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), majoring in [ECE](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/). I am fortunately to be advised by [Prof. Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/index.html) Prior to master, I receieved my bachelorâ€™s degree in Engineering Mechanics in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My research interest lies in Learning-based Robot Manipulation.
